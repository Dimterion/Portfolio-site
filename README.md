# Portfolio Site built to learn React

This site is made to learn React using [official documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org/). It may change over time depending on the needs of further learning.

## Live Version

[Portfolio Site](https://portfolio-site-dimterion.vercel.app/)

## Details

Although it's called a Portfolio Site, I'm mostly using it to play around with some of the techniques / tools.

Currently it consists of various blocks that I've inserted into its different parts, not focussing on the design aspect too much. I wanted to see how everything works together and simply organized it into something useful for myself.

## Built with

React, React Router, JavaScript, CSS, HTML
